  "Message": "I’ve been trial-running TechCat Studio for about a week and it’s been brilliant for bootstrapping my agent-based workflow—but I keep hunting for a single place to reach the team. At the moment I’m piecing together info from blog posts, GitHub issues, and Discord threads. A dedicated “Contact & Community” page with links to: (1) a direct support email, (2) partnership inquiry form, and (3) Slack/Discord invite would make it far easier to share ideas and report bugs. Bonus points for office hours or a roadmap link so we know what’s coming.",
