# Product Requirements Document

## Project Name
`TechCat Studio`

---

## Product Overview
TechCat Studio is an innovative AI-native developer workspace crafted to revolutionize the early and ongoing phases of AI-powered software development. Designed as a web application, this platform aims to enhance the efficiency of developers working with OpenAI's Codex Agents. By allowing users to input product information and automatically generate Codex-optimized infrastructure files such as PRD, TASKS, and AGENTS, TechCat Studio accelerates the MVP software development process. This tool bridges the gap between developers and AI agents, promising a streamlined and standard approach to creating agent-based software products.

## Core Objectives
- Streamline the creation and management of agent infrastructure files.
- Enhance standardization and efficiency in AI-native software development.
- Integrate seamlessly with developer workflows to encourage rapid prototyping and iteration.
- Provide robust tools for converting user feedback into actionable development tasks.

---

## Target Users
TechCat Studio is tailored for:
- *AI-native developers* who require agile and adaptive development environments.
- *Solo founders and indie hackers* looking to maximize development efficiency with minimal resources.
- *Technical product teams* needing standardized processes in AI software development.
- *Internal tools developers* striving for effective integration of AI in enterprise solutions.
- *Codex enthusiasts* eager to leverage AI for enhanced coding productivity.
