# Product Requirements Document Template

## Project Name
`TechCat Studio`

---

## Product Overview
**TechCat Studio** is an innovative AI-native developer workspace that revolutionizes the way developers build software by automating and streamlining processes with AI agents. It is designed to support developers utilizing OpenAI's Codex Agents by allowing them to easily generate and manage crucial infrastructure files, thus accelerating the development of MVP software products. The workspace enhances the development experience by providing a web-based application that understands and optimizes workflows for AI-driven projects. Its focus is on turning user feedback into actionable work, maintaining project structure, and integrating seamlessly with existing development environments.

---

## Core Objectives
- Enable developers to quickly generate and manage `.codex/` infrastructure files to enhance the development process.
- Reduce the time consumption and complexity involved in creating agent infrastructure files.
- Provide a standardized, adaptable, and scalable workspace for AI-native developer needs.
- Facilitate intuitive integration with existing platforms such as GitHub for smooth project management.
- Incorporate user feedback into actionable development tasks to ensure continuous improvement of project features.

---

## Target Users
- **AI-native developers** who are building or maintaining software powered by AI agents.
- **Solo founders and indie hackers** seeking efficient tools for rapid prototyping and MVP development.
- **Technical product teams** looking to streamline their use of AI-agent automation in early-stage and continuous development.
- **Internal tools developers** aiming for seamless integration of AI-driven functionalities into enterprise solutions.
- **Codex enthusiasts** who require specific templates and environments optimized for Codex Agents.

---

## Core Features (MVP)
- **Project Management**: Create and manage multiple projects, each with its own set of infrastructure files.
- **AI-Optimized File Generation**: Input project data via an intuitive form to automatically generate Codex-optimized infrastructure files (e.g., PRD, TASKS, AGENTS).
- **File Exportation and Editing**: Download, export, and edit generated files easily to fit specific project needs or workflows.
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly integrate projects with GitHub to ensure version control and team collaboration.
