# Product Requirements Document Template

## Project Name
`TechCat Studio`

---

## Product Overview
TechCat Studio is an innovative AI-native developer workspace designed to transform and streamline the early and ongoing phases of building software powered by AI agents. By leveraging OpenAI's Codex, it enables developers to input project information and seamlessly generate Codex-optimized infrastructure files. These files, such as PRD, TASKS, and AGENTS, provide enhanced context for AI-driven software development tools, significantly reducing the time and effort required to create MVP software products.

---

## Core Objectives
- Streamline the process of generating standard agent infrastructure files to boost efficiency.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for developers to manage projects and integrate seamlessly with popular tools like GitHub.
- Leverage OpenAI's Codex to enable automated and sophisticated infrastructure development processes.
- Enhance flexibility with scalable deployment in the Azure cloud environment.

## Target Users
TechCat Studio is crafted for:
- **AI-native developers**: Individuals leveraging AI to develop software systems.
- **Solo founders and indie hackers**: Entrepreneurs needing rapid prototyping and development efficiency.
- **Technical product teams**: Teams involved in AI-driven product developments looking for an integrated development workspace.
- **Internal tools developers**: Developers creating bespoke solutions within organizations that could benefit from Codex enhancements.
- **Codex enthusiasts**: Users keen to explore and utilize Codex for its unparalleled AI capabilities.

---

## Core Features (MVP)
- **Project Management**: Users can create, manage, and organize multiple AI-driven projects.
- **Infrastructure File Generation**: Input forms that translate user detail into comprehensive Codex-compatible files.
- **Export and Edit**: Functionality to export generated files, with options for local editing.
- **GitHub Integration**: Sync projects directly with GitHub repositories, enabling rapid deployment and collaboration.
