# Architecture Document Template

## ðŸ§± System Overview
DataSage is a web-based AI-powered data exploration tool designed to simplify the interaction with tabular data through natural language processing. The system is built using a modern tech stack that includes Next.js and React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and Azure services for AI integration and storage. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and efficient, leveraging Azure OpenAI for natural language processing and PostgreSQL for structured data storage. The integration of these components allows for seamless data upload, querying, and visualization, providing users with an intuitive and powerful data exploration experience.

## ðŸ§± Codex Infrastructure Files Explained
- `AGENTS.md`: Agent roster and prompt responsibilities
- `PRD.md`: Product vision, scope, and goals
- `TASK-LOG.json`: Completed tasks (append-only history)
- `PROPOSED-TASKS.md`: Future or suggested system-generated work
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Technical implementation guide and prompt interface contract

---

## ðŸ¤– Agent I/O Conventions
Clarify how agents exchange information using markdown. Mention formatting rules, metadata expectations, and give an example entry for `TASK-LOG.json`.

### Key Conventions
- Markdown format required
- Output should target a single `.codex/` file
- Task Metadata must include agent, task id, date, summary, and output files

### Example: `TASK-LOG.json` Entry
```json
{
  "task_id": "task-999",
  "agent": "frontend_specialist",
  "date": "2025-06-25",
  "summary": "Added support for generating JSON-based task logs and rendering them in dashboard.",
  "output_files": ["apps/techcat-studio/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx"]
}
```

---

## ðŸ§  Agent Orchestration Principles
- Agents are stateless; they rely on `TASK-LOG.json` for inferred memory
- Prompts are scoped to a single goal
- Agent chaining via `Once complete, invoke task_logger`
- Output is written to `.codex/` and reflected in UI where needed

---

## ðŸ’ƒ Storage & Data Flows

### Markdown-First Architecture
- Local-first by design for `.codex/`
- `.md` files act as both human- and LLM-readable data

### Storage Evolution
```markdown
| Stage    | Mechanism                                                    |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| MVP      | Markdown + Azure Blob Storage                                |
| Post-MVP | PostgreSQL (structured feedback) + GitHub file sync          |
```

---

## ðŸ“¡ APIs & External Services

### Used APIs
- Azure OpenAI for natural language processing
- Azure Blob Storage for file storage
- PostgreSQL for structured data management

### Optional Backend
- Integration with additional data sources like Airtable and Google Sheets for extended data handling capabilities.
