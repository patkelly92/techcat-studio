# AGENTS Document Template

This template guides the creation of a new `AGENTS.md` file. It is written for an LLM that must infer and invent a suitable roster of Codex-compatible agents for the project. Use information from `.codex/PRD.md`, `.codex/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and existing prompts to craft concise, well defined agent profiles. The output should read like a professional brief generated by an experienced AI engineer.

Begin with a short introduction that explains the purpose of the file and how the agents collaborate. Then, for each agent you deem necessary, create a dedicated markdown section in the following structure. Invent names and details as needed to cover the project's workflows and goals.

## 🧠 Name
Provide a short, memorable code name in `lower_snake_case` that captures the agent's identity and focus.

## 🧑‍💼 Role
Summarize in one sentence what this agent is responsible for.

## 🎯 Goal
Describe the main objective or outcome the agent strives to achieve. Keep it brief and actionable.

## 📚 Background
Offer a line or two of plausible history or expertise that motivates the agent's behavior and strengths.

## ✅ Responsibilities
Bullet out the key tasks this agent performs. Reference project needs such as document generation, feedback processing, deployment, or other duties implied by the surrounding docs.

Repeat these sections for as many agents as the project requires. Emphasize clarity and purpose in every description. Do not use placeholders or boilerplate beyond these instructions.
