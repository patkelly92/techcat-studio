# Product Requirements Document Template

This template is used to generate a detailed PRD from user input. You must **expand upon vague or incomplete input**, **infer missing details**, and **write as if you’re a product strategist**.

Respond in markdown format using the following structure below:
<BEGIN prd-template.md>

## Project Name
Name of the project as provided by the user. Enclose the project name in backticks.

---

## 🧭 Product Overview
Describe what the product does, its purpose, and the context it lives in. If the user input is minimal, flesh it out. Use confident and strategic language. Make it sound like it belongs in a pitch deck.

---

## Core Objectives
List the primary, high-level goals this product aims to achieve. Each objective should be concise, actionable, and focused on the product’s intended impact or value. If objectives are missing, infer them based on the product overview and target users. Use a numbered or bulleted list for clarity. Avoid implementation details—focus on outcomes and purpose.

---

## 🧑‍🎯 Target Users
Identify who this product is built for. Infer industry, job roles, and level of technical proficiency. Don’t just reword the user’s text — elaborate and provide nuance.

---

## 🧩 Core Features (MVP)
List 3–5 core features based on user input and reasonable assumptions. Highlight what makes the product unique or valuable. Separate by category if necessary (UI/Backend/deployment)

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
List the likely technologies used. If not specified, propose an ideal stack. Prioritize modern, scalable tools relevant to the problem. Provide this in the form of a markdown table.

---

## 💡 Stretch Goals (Post-MVP)
List advanced features or ideas the team could consider later. You can invent these based on your understanding of the product space.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria
Define how success will be measured (e.g., user adoption, time-to-output, engagement). If user did not provide this, propose KPIs or milestones based on typical product goals.

---

## 🪵 Known Constraints
Mention any risks, limitations, or assumptions. If none were specified, note plausible concerns based on scope or tooling.
