# Example Inputs #1

# Product Overview:
I want to build an AI-native developer workspace designed to streamline, manage and automate the early and ongoing phases of building software powered by AI agents. It will be a web app that enables developers that work with OpenAI's Codex Agents to input information about their product and then generate codex optimized infrastructure files like (PRD, TASKS, AGENTS, etc.). These files will speed up the building of MVP software products by enhancing the context fed to Agent based software development tools.

# Target Users:
AI-native developers, Solo founders and indie hackers, Technical product teams, internal tools developers, Codex enthusiasts

# Top 3 User Pain Points:
Creating agent infrastructure files is a time consuming process, there isn't alot of standardization of templates that work well with codex agents yet

# Core Features:
Ability for the user to create and manage various projects, take in user input via a form and generate agent infrastructure files, export/download/edit generated files, github integration

# Tech Stack:
React, Next.JS, FastAPI, Postgres SQL, OpenAI

# Constraints:
Potential cost and scaling with utilization of OpenAI endpoints, must deploy to Azure

# Stretch goals:
Ability to integrate to user's github, user authentication, implementing a feedback form on the site which takes user feedback and automates the generation of an agent task to fix a bug or implement a suggestion.

# Tone / Branding Personality:
The tone of my brand doesn't take itself too seriously. Fun and not too corporate.
